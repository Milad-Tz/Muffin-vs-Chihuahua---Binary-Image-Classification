## Overview

This project aims to build a binary image classifier to distinguish between images of muffins (1) and chihuahuas (0) using transfer learning. The project utilizes the VGG16 convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet, with a focus on feature extraction and model selection through K-Fold Cross Validation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [Muffin vs Chihuahua - Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/muffin-vs-chihuahua-image-classification).

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation & Preprocessing
- **Google Colab & Google Drive Integration**: Access and organize the dataset using Google Drive.
- **Data Generators**: Set up to preprocess images for feature extraction.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Class Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of muffins and chihuahuas.
- **Visualizations**: Visualize sample images from the dataset to understand its structure.

### 3. Feature Extraction
- **VGG16 Model**: Extract high-level features from images using the pre-trained VGG16 model.

### 4. Model Selection
- **K-Fold Cross Validation**: Evaluate three different neural network architectures.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Identify the most suitable architecture based on cross-validation results.

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Learning Rate Tuning**: Fine-tune the modelâ€™s hyperparameters to optimize performance.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- **Test Set Performance**: Evaluate the final model on the test dataset.
- **Metrics**: Analyze accuracy, confusion matrices, and other key metrics.
